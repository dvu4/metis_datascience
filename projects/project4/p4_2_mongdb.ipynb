       "   'On the roster: Trump negotiating with Senate Dems on guns\\xa0- Candidates’ desperation plays ahead of debate cutoff - Biden tries damage control - Small donors flock to Trump - She had no chill TRUMP NEGOTIATING WITH SENATE DEMS ON GUNSNYT: “[President Trump] has said repeatedly that [Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] favors expanding background checks, the leader has not committed to taking up the bill... Mr. Trump on Sunday telephoned Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat who has been one of the leading voices in Congress for gun control, an indication that the president is interested in pursuing legislation. Earlier in the week, Mr. Murphy had contacted the White House to indicate that he was willing to work with Mr. Trump on the issue, which prompted the call. The conversation was positive, with Mr. Trump indicating that he was serious about persuading Republicans to act, according to officials familiar with their discussion. And the two agreed to set up a staff-level dialogue this week between their offices and those of Senators Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia…”Murphy optimistic - The [Torrington, Conn.] Register Citizen: “Connecticut’s Democratic senators are expressing guarded optimism on new gun legislation in the aftermath of mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, with Sen. Chris Murphy talking to President Donald Trump on Tuesday in a phone call that Trump described as ‘a very good conversation.’ Murphy, who along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal has carved out a leading position on guns among Senate Democrats, talked to Trump about a path to reviving the 2013 background-checks bill that stalled in the Senate just four months after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, according to the New York Times. … The House, now under Democratic control, passed two gun bills in February. All of Connecticut’s five Democratic House members voted in favor of them. In the Senate, however, McConnell remains in charge.”Don Jr. said to dissent - WSJ: “Amid the increased discussion about gun control, some Trump advisers have urged the president not to throw his support behind any of the gun-control measures being discussed in Congress, including so-called red-flag legislation introduced by top Trump ally Sen. Lindsay Graham (R., S.C.), which aims at temporarily blocking dangerous people from accessing firearms. Some advisers have expressed concern that such legislation could violate the Second Amendment and alienate conservative voters. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son who often speaks with his father about his views on gun laws, has raised concerns about both red-flag legislation and about tightening background checks, according to people familiar with the matter.”House Judiciary returning early, but no plan for action - WaPo: “A House panel with jurisdiction over firearms is expected to return early from the six-week congressional recess to consider additional gun-control measures in hopes of upping pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to act. But there’s one problem: Democrats are privately sparring over what exactly to approve. House Democrats universally agree on expanding background checks, legislation they easily passed in February. They’ve also coalesced around proposals restricting high-capacity magazines, instituting ‘red flag’ laws that keep guns from individuals showing warning signs of violence, and potentially even legislation on hate crimes – ideas the House Judiciary Committee is expected to consider the week of Labor Day, according to two people familiar with the plan, a week before the full House is officially scheduled to return.”THE RULEBOOK: FATAL CHARMS < LUCKY CHARMS \\n“Here, my countrymen, impelled by every motive that ought to influence an enlightened people, let us make a firm stand for our safety, our tranquillity, our dignity, our reputation. Let us at last break the fatal charm which has too long seduced us from the paths of felicity and prosperity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 15TIME OUT: CARL WEISS JR., R.I.P. NYT: “Carl A. Weiss Jr. was 3 months old when his father died in Baton Rouge, La. The cause, his mother would later tell him cryptically, was a fatal firearms accident. He was not to know the truth. … The boy would not remain clueless for long, though. When he was 10, Carl Jr. stumbled across a full-page painting by John McCrady in Life magazine, one in a series of dramatic scenes from 20th-century American history. In graphic detail, the painting depicted a wounded Huey P. Long, Louisiana’s United States senator and former governor, clutching his stomach with his bloodied left hand moments after his bodyguards had machine-gunned his purported assassin, a slight, bespectacled, white-coated 28-year-old man whose bullet-riddled body had slumped to the marble floor. Studying the painting and reading the accompanying text, young Carl was stunned to discover that the man portrayed as the killer was identified as his father, Dr. Carl A. Weiss.”Flag on the play? -\\xa0Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM\\xa0with\\xa0your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD\\nTrump job performance\\nAverage approval: 42.4 percentAverage disapproval:\\xa053.6 percentNet Score: -11.2 pointsChange from one week ago:\\xa0no change\\n[Average includes: IBD: 40% approve - 56% disapprove; Gallup: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 40% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 44% approve - 53% disapprove.]WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\\xa0\\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York has poured more than $1 million into advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire. Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, bought a local ad in Bedminster, N.J., where President Trump is vacationing this week. And Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has urged her supporters to try to improve their chances of being selected for online polls. They and other lower-tier candidates are desperately searching for voters who can propel them to 2 percent support in qualifying polls…”Sanders’ rebooted in wake of weak debate performance - Politico: “A little over a month ago, despite putting on a brave face publicly, Bernie Sanders’ aides privately concluded that a shakeup was needed for his presidential campaign. The Vermont senator had neglected to practice in mock sessions before the first 2020 debate, and failed to aggressively take on former Vice President Joe Biden on stage. On the trail, he was sticking to the old hits: His stump speech sounded remarkably similar to the one he delivered in his first presidential bid, and he gave a major address touting democratic socialism that mirrored his talk on the same subject in 2015. … Now, Sanders and his team have settled on a new strategy designed to make him stand out in the massive field: They’re betting that a renewed focus on his signature proposal of ‘Medicare for All’ is the key to jump-starting his candidacy and overtaking Biden as the race ramps up this fall.”Beto slogs on - Dallas Morning News: “Beto O’Rourke will return to the campaign trail on Thursday, ending a 12-day hiatus that began when 22 people were gunned down in a bustling Walmart in his hometown of El Paso. He&aposll start with a speech in El Paso. His campaign announced the plan on Wednesday morning. On Saturday night, he will appear at a Democratic dinner in Little Rock, putting him in front of at least 1,000 party activists in one of the states with a Super Tuesday primary. … Unlike nearly two dozen 2020 rivals, the former three-term congressman skipped the Iowa State Fair last weekend, along with a gun control forum in Des Moines hastily organized after the El Paso killings and a spree in Dayton, Ohio, that left nine people dead hours later.”Abrams nominates self for vice president - NYT: “Stacey Abrams made it official this week that she would not seek the presidency after months of speculation among Democrats, becoming one of the most prominent party leaders to pass on the 2020 race. But in an interview Tuesday night, she said she was open to being considered for the No. 2 spot by ‘any nominee.’ Ms. Abrams, who drew national attention during her unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia last year, said that she would focus her next year on identifying and stemming voter suppression efforts throughout the country, a major priority for her for years, instead of running for president or the Senate. But she has remained close to the presidential race, meeting privately with several candidates and topping lists of potential vice presidents.”Harris and others on campaign trail miss many votes - San Francisco Chronicle: “Virtually every Democratic candidate, with a day job or not, was in Iowa last week, visiting the must-stop state fair and a Democratic dinner that featured each of them with five-minute speeches. … While there, California Sen. Kamala Harris said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should bring the chamber back into session to vote on House-passed gun control legislation that would make background checks nearly universal. … But Harris has nonetheless missed more than 40% of votes this year, as have some of her competitors. She pledged not to miss roll calls if her vote would be a difference-maker.”BIDEN TRIES DAMAGE CONTROL Politico: “Joe Biden’s presidential campaign is quietly playing cleanup with dozens of immigration activists and Latino leaders — weeks after upsetting them by using what they considered loaded language to describe his views on immigration policy. Biden said at the July 31 Democratic debate that undocumented immigrants need to ‘get in line’ and that the country has been right to ‘cherry-pick’ high-skilled immigrants, notably those with advanced degrees. That language, more commonly used by conservatives, triggered widespread criticism from immigrant rights activists, some of whom said the former vice president was echoing ‘Republican talking points’ on how migrants are admitted to the United States. The campaign quickly embarked on damage control. Aides assuaged aggrieved activists, and Biden had a closed-door meeting with Latino leaders in San Diego before his speech at the UnidosUS conference last week. … Activists view the ‘get in line’ language as a dodge invoked by immigration hard-liners.”Trump strategy is using Biden’s words against him - WaPo: “Joe Biden’s verbal miscues have always been part of his charm, baked into his reputation as a plain-spoken politician who delivers impossible-to-diagram sentences and whose rhetorical flourishes can quickly veer off course. But now, that habit is colliding with a much more damaging narrative pushed aggressively by President Trump and nagging at some of Biden’s fellow Democrats: that he is a man past his prime. ‘He walked into a trap you could see 100 yards away,’ said Grant Woodard, an attorney and longtime Iowa Democratic consultant unaligned with a candidate. ‘It does directly call into question people’s concerns: Should you really be the front-runner? Are you really electable?’ Over the last few days, Biden has made a string of small missteps while campaigning during a crucial stretch in Iowa. He said the most recent mass shootings occurred in Houston and Michigan, although they actually took place in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.”SMALL DONORS FLOCK TO TRUMP Fox News: “The Republican Party has long been panned by its detractors as the party of big money and big donors -- but donation patterns have changed measurably under President Trump, a Fox News analysis of campaign finance data shows. Sixty-one percent of money raised directly by the Trump campaign this election cycle came from small donors (donations under $200), according to Federal Election Commission figures. That is similar to the proportion Trump raised during the 2016 election cycle, when 65 percent of donations were under $200. And this is dramatically higher than previous Republican nominees. Mitt Romney raised 26 percent of his direct contributions from small donations in 2012, and John McCain raised 25 percent from small donations in 2008. Campaign finance analysts say the data indicates grassroots enthusiasm for Trump&aposs populist message.”HICKENLOOPER READY TO JUMP INTO SENATE RUN NYT: “Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado is in discussions about ending his presidential bid and entering the race for his state’s Republican-held Senate seat, potentially giving Democrats a strong candidate in a race they must win to have hopes of retaking the chamber in 2021, according to four Democrats familiar with his thinking. Mr. Hickenlooper, who is mired at the bottom of public polling of the presidential race, hopped into Senator Michael Bennet’s car on Friday night in this Northern Iowa town to discuss his impending decision, said Democrats familiar with the discussion, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential talks. The two drove around Clear Lake for about 20 minutes ahead of the Wing Ding dinner, a Democratic fund-raiser that drew 21 presidential candidates. Aides and advisers to the two men, who have been both allies and rivals over their careers in Colorado politics, declined to reveal what was discussed.”\\xa0Donors told to wait as Pompeo considers run - Bloomberg: Republican political donors have been told to hold off contributing to the 2020 U.S. Senate race in Kansas in the expectation that Secretary of State Michael Pompeo may decide to run, according to two people familiar with the matter. A Pompeo ally has been advising potential contributors to wait until after the secretary of state makes his decision, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a private message communicated to donors. The top U.S. diplomat and former CIA director, who served as a congressman in Kansas’s 4th district from 2011-2017, has until June to enter the race. Pompeo has given mixed signals about his intentions.”\\xa0New Jersey freshman Dem draws well-heeled challenger - Burlington County Times: “David Richter, the wealthy former CEO of Hill International, announced Monday he had filed the required paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to challenge for Van Drew’s 2nd District seat. The former chief executive of one of the nation’s largest construction firms is officially joining the Republican field seeking to challenge for Democrat Jeff Van Drew’s congressional seat next year.”Duncan Hunter’s legal win a political woe\\xa0 - Fox 5: “A federal judge in San Diego Tuesday pushed back Rep. Duncan Hunter&aposs trial for alleged misuse of $250,000 in campaign funds until early next year. U.S. District Judge Thomas Whelan postponed the trial to Jan. 14, with Duncan&aposs attorneys seeking to have Whelan&aposs prior ruling against dismissing the case heard by an appeals court. Whelan ruled earlier this summer against Hunter&aposs motions to have a 60- count indictment against him thrown out. The congressman&aposs attorneys have appealed the rulings, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet ruled whether it will take jurisdiction in the case. Hunter, R-Alpine, was indicted along with his wife on five dozen criminal counts, including wire fraud, conspiracy, and falsification of records. Margaret Hunter, 44, pleaded guilty last month to a conspiracy charge. She faces up to five years in federal custody and a fine of up to $250,000 when she is sentenced in December.”Insurgent gets key endorsement in Mississippi runoff - \\xa0WMC5: “DeSoto County state Rep.

Foster found himself back in the spotlight Tuesday as he announced his endorsement of former rival Bill Waller. Waller will face Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves in a runoff Aug. 27. ‘This was a decision that I prayed about quite a bit,’ Foster said. He says it came down to what he thinks the state needs: Change. ‘A lot of people wanted me to sit this out and not get involved in a runoff, because getting involved in a runoff election can sometime have political consequences and you may upset people on one side or the other,’ said Foster.

She is also completing a doctorate in Renaissance literature. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.',\n",
       "   ' (CNN)Monday was not a good day for Scarlett Johansson on the internet. The most recent edition of As If magazine -- a 4-years-old niche luxury magazine that is no doubt delighted with the publicity -- features the multimillionaire actress in conversation with the artist David Salle, who also styled her for an accompanying fashion shoot. In between modelling the latest Audemars Piguet watch (price: $26,800) and Dolce & Gabbana floral dress (price: $2,356), the two found time to talk about contemporary controversies in casting practice.',\n",
       "   'Johansson was already a lightning rod for those who campaign for greater diversity in Hollywood. Last year, she dropped out of playing a trans man in the proposed movie \"Rub & Tug,\" after campaigners pointed out that the role was a lost opportunity to cast a trans actor. (No actor has since been announced to replace her and the movie remains unmade.) In 2017, she starred in a remake of the anime movie, \"Ghost in the Shell,\" as a white-bodied cyborg who takes on the brain of a Japanese woman. (Both soul and body were Japanese in the original manga; this was a meta-level of white identity-snatching.) ',\n",
       "   'So Twitter was already primed to take down Johansson when As If published her response to a question by Salle about casting and identity:  \"You know, as an actor I should be allowed to play any person, or any tree, or any animal because that is my job and the requirements of my job.\" Twitter is not pleased. Johansson has been forced to issue an apologetic clarification. ',\n",
       "   \"It's easy to get angry about wealthy white actresses seeming to dismiss their social critics; it's also easy to mock clicktivists who seem to virtue signal on social media. As ever, it's worth trying to think a bit more critically about what's going on here. \",\n",
       "   'One reason people are so hurt by Johansson\\'s comments, particularly transgender people, is that if you read Johannson\\'s reference to \"any tree, or any animal\" in the context of her mooted role in \"Rub & Tug,\" it sounds like she\\'s comparing playing a transgender person to playing a tree. Given how frequently trans people are dehumanized, often as a prelude to violence, that is deeply threatening. When people from minority groups ask Hollywood to think a bit more carefully about who portrays them, they\\'re asking to be treated like human beings -- asking for recognition that their stories are human stories. No one has ever stopped Scarlett Johansson from playing a tree -- whereas they have objected to her playing a trans man or a Japanese woman. The difference between the two is basic humanity.',\n",
       "   'Johansson is right, however, as she notes in her clarification, that her comments have been \"taken out of context.\" She wasn\\'t talking about \"Rub & Tug\" or trans people explicitly -- the film is mentioned nowhere in the piece. It\\'s actually artist David Salle who complains at most length about \"mass hysteria\" by diversity campaigners, and who hasn\\'t been publicly criticized. The internet -- even the \"woke\" internet -- will never attack a man when there\\'s a woman available instead. And let\\'s be frank: a branch of the activist left has had Johansson in their sights ever since she endorsed SodaStream, an Israeli company once based in the West Bank.',\n",
       "   'Johansson\\'s real mistake was to use the word \"allowed.\" The problem in Hollywood isn\\'t who\\'s allowed to play each role, but who gets the opportunity. There are very few transgender actors working at a prominent level in Hollywood, and none on Forbes\\' lists of the highest-paid actors (which is, ironically, divided into male and female lists). Johannsson tops the women\\'s list, earning $40.5 million between mid-year 2017 and 2018. As she delicately poses in one designer dress after another, it\\'s hard to listen to her complain about not being \"allowed\" to do things.',\n",
       "   'But Johannsson has a point, and that is what\\'s always lost in these moments of culture war frenzy. Her wider interview explores the limitations of method acting -- the acting process developed by Konstantin Stanislavski in the early 1900s by which an actor completely immerses themself in the imagined life of a character, a bit like self-hypnosis -- because acting is not simply a question of becoming somebody else. Acting is about pretend; about imagination. (Stanislavski called his method \"the art of experiencing\" as opposed to \"the art of representation.\") We risk losing something fundamental about storytelling when we deny ourselves the freedom to imagine being someone else. To insist that we only represent our own stories is to deny the fundamental importance of empathy.',\n",
       "   \"That's not a fashionable line to take when the more urgent cause is the basic representation of non-white, non-cis people among the power ranks of Hollywood. But in the long run, it matters too. Nor is it helpful to suggest that everyone needs to define or disclose every aspect of themselves in order to exist creatively -- as a writer, I object deeply to the idea that I need to disclose my sexuality in order to write, for example, in defense of gay marriage. We are all mixtures of influences and identities, and we don't have to define ourselves as monoliths in order to engage in storytelling or commentary. That's how labeling can become a new form of outing.\",\n",

       "   '\"It is hard to recreate a series that was so popular and expect to match that kind of fervor,\" she says. \"I just knew that we needed to craft a series that was for today. We could use what worked for it the first time around, which is an awesome \\'make-better series\\' in itself. There\\'s something there for the whole family kind of thing and then highly craft it for today\\'s audiences, which kind insist on more connection, more authenticity.\"',\n",
       "   'Production decided to change a few things right away. With LGBTQ rights in the spotlight, the show would leave New York and film in cities across America, and they incorporated interviews with the Fab Five in each episode, so viewers could hear their thoughts and feelings as they connected with the heroes.',\n",
       "   '\"I think that was probably the biggest, concrete change from the outset,\" Lane says.',\n",
       "   'Casting the Fab Five',\n",
       "   'Gervais was tasked with finding a fresh team of experts, and says the pressure to get it right was overwhelming. Starting with nearly 300 men in the various professions, they narrowed it down to 60 guys then held a \"chemistry test\" in Los Angeles to see who best worked together. ',\n",
       "   '\"The pressure, I\\'ll say this, you know, I remember obviously the original Fab Five and they were incredible and they still are,\" Gervais says. \"The idea of even trying to fill those shoes, I think, felt like a tremendous undertaking. And again, a very risky one. And so we had to get it right. There was no choice.\" ',\n",
       "   '\"They have to know what they\\'re talking about within their vertical. These guys, obviously they know what they\\'re doing, but they do have to have the people skills too. I think first and foremost, we always looked for an ability to tap into their personal and professional experience as a gay man doing what they do. They have to level with the heroes and talk to them in a way that\\'s meaningful and can really help somebody.\"',\n",
       "   'Sixty men that stood out were brought to a hotel in Glendale, where for three days, they sat in front of producers and Netflix executives and were directed to be themselves. ',\n",
       "   '\"I remember it like it was yesterday. We were all sitting in a room, and we did things like fishbowl questions with them. Fishbowl questions is like speed dating. We\\'d all talk. And then we started to watch them,\" Gervais says. ',\n",
       "   'The team gradually began to see the right blend of experts emerge. ',\n",
       "   '\"Everybody has their turn to come in and we sort of started to see this sort of bond form a little bit with Karamo and Bobby,\" Gervais recalls. \"And then Tan kind of fell into the mix and then all of a sudden, we brought in Jonathan and then it felt like, wow, and then Antoni came in and all of a sudden it was the five of them. It was like putting together a magic puzzle.\"',\n",
       "   'Highlighting the heroes',\n",
       "   \"In the beginning, production would look to secure locations for the show but didn't yet have permission from Netflix to say exactly what the show was, so it was difficult to convince people to give them a shot.\",\n",
       "   '\"It\\'s 100% much easier now for us to secure locations than it might have been in Season 1 in Atlanta,\" laughs Lane. ',\n",
       "   'Production has staffers who study the cities they choose, with the aim of highlighting the fabric of a particular community and the people who live there. ',\n",
       "   \"For Lane, it's especially hard -- yet rewarding, she says -- because she's away from home most of the year filming the show. \",\n",
       "   '\"It\\'s tough ... [but] you\\'re watching humanity be kind. So it\\'s beautiful,\" she says. ',\n",
       "   '\"Once we land in a city, we do a deep dive,\" Lane says. \"We maybe have 20 potential people [to feature on the show] and we\\'ll meet with these people and find our best candidates from that, but also in the street, anywhere.\" She adds, the important questions when casting are, \"Who\\'s ready for change, who\\'s vulnerable, whose stories haven\\'t been told before?\" ',\n",
       "   'Executive producer Jordana Hochman, who was brought in on the ITV end, says choosing the heroes is a very \"personal experience.\" She\\'s found that their heroes share a sense of hopefulness that has made the show a family-friendly experience.',\n",
       "   '\"I know a lot of families where parents and tweens and younger kids are watching the show together,\" she says. \"My daughter\\'s 13, she\\'s obsessed with the show, and so are all her friends. It\\'s something that we can watch together.\"',\n",
       "   'For Season 4, Gervais teases that we will meet a new hero this season who will likely bring viewers to tears, John Stoner. The divorced dad is a sports superfan known in Kansas City as the \"Cat Suit Guy\" for the onesies he wears to local games. His 10-year-old daughter has had enough. ',\n",
       "   '\"I had several people write in about him specifically, which is weird, you know, like people all knew him and all felt like this guy is right for a makeover, which I thought was kind of funny,\" Gervais says. \"But it\\'s not that easy. There\\'s a massive checklist the heroes have to meet, and all these requirements that these people have to have in order to really make for a wonderful hero.\"',\n",
       "   'Yes, production cries. A lot',\n",
       "   '\"One of the first things is we typically are looking for people that don\\'t see this coming,\" Gervais says. \"So people that write in about themselves, often it\\'s not the right fit. It\\'s typically people that are nominated. Those tend to be the heroes that we go for. And the biggest thing for us with heroes is we constantly will ask the question of why now? Why does this person need this now? Why are they ready for this? What is happening in their lives right now that makes this the perfect opportunity for them?  Sometimes the answer is really obvious, and then other times it\\'s someone that we absolutely love. We love something about them.\" ',\n",
       "   'The love is real and so are the tears.',\n",
       "   '\"It\\'s funny. We never aimed for it,\" Hochman says of the tear-jerking reputation of the show. \"We just leaned into it instead of leaning away from it. And I think, you know, I think with other productions, or with other networks, maybe there would have been more of a resistance in terms of having such an openly, overtly emotional show. But we all collectively wanted to go there. That\\'s what the show wants to be. And we allowed it to go down that road.\"',\n",

It\\'s so transformative that yeah, you can\\'t help but grow close to them. And they grow close, especially with, I think the team in the field and with the Fab Five,\" Gervais says. ',\n",

       "  'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/style/article/francis-bacon/index.html',\n",
       "  'article': [\"Artist Takashi Murakami is CNN Style's latest guest editor. He has commissioned a series of features on identity.\",\n",
       "   'Francis Bacon\\'s work has always been instantly recognizable. \"Nightmarish horror\" was how art critic David Sylvester described it in 1954, citing the general critical response to his paintings. Raw, dark and visceral, Bacon\\'s images were disquieting from the outset. ',\n",
       "   'Just look at 1944\\'s \"Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion,\" his first masterpiece. Here was an early example of what became his favored form: a triptych of disturbing imagery featuring distorted limbs, eyeless heads and open snarling mouths -- the teeth bared and ready to savage -- all painted on a glowing orange backdrop. ',\n",
       "   'Bacon was already in his mid-30s by then -- \"a late starter,\" as he put it. Yet this single painting dramatically announced his arrival as a major artist. At the time, London was being bombarded with V-1 and V-2 rockets from Nazi Germany but Bacon drew his inspiration from elsewhere. The image transcended traditional religious iconography.',\n",
       "   'Stylistically, Bacon was freed up to experiment, his artistic identity shaped by the radical work of his early hero, Picasso (whose 1927 show in Paris left a profound impression on the Irish-born painter). ',\n",
       "   'Just as importantly, he was inspired by Greek tragedy; he was obsessed with the playwright Aeschylus and the Furies of his \"Oresteia\" trilogy. Tellingly, when he talked about the Furies, goddesses of vengeance in classical mythology, Bacon would habitually quote a passage from the plays: \"The reek of human blood smiles out at me.\"',\n",
       "   \"In his famous 1944 work, Bacon -- consciously it seems -- painted the Furies and gave us an indelible image of menace, anguish, terror and revenge. The triptych somehow sears into the brain. Seen in the flesh, it's an image that is hard to get out of your head. The painting was first exhibited in April 1945, in the final months of World War II. The allies were just liberating the Nazi concentration camps, and haunting images were emerging -- grotesque piles of bodies and pitifully emaciated prisoners. Bacon's masterpiece jangled a nerve. It still does.\",\n",
       "   'Early influences',\n",
       "   \"Bacon painted largely from memory and photos, in a small, chaotic studio in London's South Kensington (the studio has since been reconstructed, complete with its original contents, at the City Gallery in Dublin). We know the artists he especially admired: Michelangelo, Velázquez, Degas, Van Gogh and Ingres. But critics have also identified some of his direct sources. A life mask of the poet William Blake, for instance, served as the basis for a series of small portraits in 1955.\",\n",
       "   \"Eadweard Muybridge's pioneering 19th century photos of human and animal movement, notably of men wrestling, had a more enduring impact. The resulting paintings are sometimes intensely sexual -- or, to be more precise, homoerotic. Bacon knew that he was gay from an early age. His authoritarian father threw him out of the family home in Dublin for wearing his mother's clothes, and he took himself to London aged 17.\",\n",
       "   'Today in the British capital, the Gagosian gallery is exhibiting what it describes as \"two of the most uninhibited images that Bacon ever painted.\" They were executed long before homosexual acts between men was decriminalized in England in 1967. \"Two Figures\" (1953) depicts two naked men, blurred and grappling like wrestlers on crumpled sheets. Is one pinning the other down? Is this agony, ecstasy or a bit of both? Their faces are distorted -- we can\\'t tell for sure.',\n",
       "   '\"Two Figures in the Grass\" (1954) is a passionate coupling with lots of pinky-white flesh. Buttocks, a leg, an ear and hair, all half-hidden in the blades of grass. The patch of grass is fenced in. Bacon often liked to frame the space -- thin vertical and horizontal lines within his paintings -- to somehow intensify the image, to box it in.',\n",
       "   'Another key inspiration came from one of silent cinema\\'s best-known sequences: a still image of a screaming woman, her glasses smashed and her face bloodied, stood on Odessa\\'s famous steps in Sergei Eisenstein\\'s 1925 film \"Battleship Potemkin.\" ',\n",
       "   'Bacon\\'s series of screaming popes, meanwhile, were inspired by Velázquez\\'s \"Portrait of Pope Innocent X.\" The paintings helped establish his reputation in the early 1950s. In Velázquez\\'s original (circa 1650), the papal mouth was clamped firmly shut. But in most of Bacon\\'s versions, of which there were around 50, he is screaming and caged. In interviews, Bacon said that he was \"always very obsessed by the actual appearance of the mouth and teeth,\" and that he had \"always hoped to paint the mouth like Monet painted a sunset.\"',\n",
       "   \"'Saying something that matters'\",\n",
       "   \"The fact is, Bacon fundamentally altered figurative painting in the 20th century. His aim wasn't so much to create a likeness, but a sense of presence. \",\n",
       "   \"Sometimes, he just did this viscerally. Viewing his work, we feel like we've stumbled into a human abattoir. At other times, his figures appear like apparitions, wraiths. Most of his subjects were his friends and lovers, his small circle of intimates or his companions from the Colony Room Club, the private members' club he frequented in London's Soho (where he was known to consume a lot of champagne).\",\n",
       "   'Although Bacon was never filmed painting, we know more about his practice than perhaps any other important 20th-century artist. And this is for one simple reason: his friendship with the aforementioned critic and curator, David Sylvester.',\n",
       "   'Sylvester wrote about Bacon with rare acuity and accessibility over a period of some 40 years. His interviews with Bacon, first published in 1975 and later expanded, remain a primary source for understanding the artist\\'s work. Sylvester\\'s conclusion was, he wrote, that \"everyone feels (whether they like the work or not)\" that Bacon \"is saying something that matters about the times in which we live.\"',\n",
       "   'Sylvester felt that Bacon achieved his greatest work in 1974. A sudden and shocking bereavement reinforced his artistic identity. George Dyer, a handsome small-time crook who\\'d become Bacon\\'s lover, was the subject of many portraits after the pair met in 1963. Dyer\\'s suicide in a Paris Hotel in 1971, just days before a Bacon retrospective at the Grand Palais, triggered a series of searing triptychs. In them, Bacon aimed to convey what he described as \"all the pulsations of a person.\" In Sylvester\\'s view, they are perhaps \"the most moving things he ever did.\"',\n",
       "   'Here was a conscious act of exorcism by Bacon -- paintings created in memory of Dyer. One of them, \"Triptych May-June 1973,\" is absolutely unsparing, a painting of pity and terror. ',\n",
       "   \"Each of the three images is framed by a door. In the left panel, Dyer is doubled up on a toilet, just as his body was found. On the right panel, he is depicted throwing up into a sink. In the center panel, Dyer's figure crouches in the darkness beneath a hanging, naked light bulb. He casts a shadow -- a bird of prey perhaps, or a Fury. Sylvester thought that this was probably Bacon's greatest painting.\",\n",
       "   \"An artist's legacy\",\n",
       "   'Bacon\\'s market value has risen by leaps and bounds since his death in 1992. Damien Hirst collects, telling the Guardian in 2006 that he owned five of his paintings. In 2013, \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud\" (1969) sold at Christie\\'s in New York for $142.4 million, then a world auction record for a work of art. From September 2019, the Pompidou Centre in Paris is putting on a new show of Bacon\\'s work.',\n",
       "   'Bacon told Sylvester that \"no artist knows in his own lifetime whether what he does will be the slightest good, because I think it takes at least seventy-five to a hundred years to sort itself out.\" But he was nonetheless aware that he had made an impact. Three retrospectives were held during his lifetime: in 1962 and 1985 at Tate Britain, and the 1971 show at the Grand Palais.',\n",
       "   \"I was filming the 1985 Tate exhibition when Bacon and his then companion (and later heir) John Edwards suddenly wandered into the space. Bacon quickly spotted the camera and they swiftly turned around. We missed the shot. Francis Bacon was essentially a private man who wasn't remotely interested in celebrity. But he definitely wanted his work to be seen.\",\n",
       "   'Top image: \"Study after Velázquez\\'s Portrait of Pope Innocent X\" by Francis Bacon. \"Francis Bacon: Couplings\" is on at the Gasogian in London until August 3, 2019. \"Bacon: Books and Painting\" opens at the Pompidou Centre on September 11, 2019.']},\n",

       "   \"This latest flurry of activity continues the drive by Trump and other Republicans elected mostly from the parts of America least touched by immigration to impose a restrictionist agenda on migration over the nearly undivided opposition of Democrats elected by the areas where most immigrants, both undocumented and legal, actually live. Though greeted without complaint by Republicans in Congress, Trump's promised raids provoked astoundingly open resistance from the mayors of virtually every large American city, from New York and Los Angeles to Chicago and Houston. \",\n",
       "   'Trump\\'s divisive tweets opened an equally imposing divide between the parties. Democrats were unvarnished and united in flatly describing Trump\\'s tweets as racist and nativist, words that elected officials have rarely applied so unabashedly to the remarks of a sitting president. Only a tiny trickle of Republicans that widened slightly as Monday progressed raised objections and the vast majority tried to avoid comment altogether. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina obliquely suggested Trump \"should aim higher\" but then compounded the President\\'s slur by calling the Democrats \"communists\" who \"hate our own country\" and are \"anti-America.\"',\n",
       "   \"This week's stark divide on both fronts, coming immediately after battles that also polarized the parties over Trump's border detention policies and his failed effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, crystallize how Trump is accelerating a long gestating shift in the axis of American politics from class interests to cultural attitudes.\",\n",
       "   'As I\\'ve written before, attitudes toward demographic, cultural and economic change have become the central fault line between the parties. Republicans mobilize what I\\'ve called a \"coalition of restoration\" centered on older, blue-collar, evangelical and non-urban whites who polls show are uneasy or frightened about the fundamental demographic, cultural and even economic trends reshaping America in the 21st century. ',\n",
       "   'Democrats counter with a competing \"coalition of transformation\" revolving around the groups -- young adults, minorities, singles, secular voters, and college-educated whites, mostly concentrated in large metropolitan areas -- who are most comfortable with the change.',\n",
       "   '\"Clearly we\\'re headed down a path where there is one party for older white Americans and then there\\'s another party for people of color and immigrants,\" says Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican US representative who was defeated last fall in a heavily diverse Miami-area district. \"And this is very dangerous. It divides our society in a dangerous way. It paralyzes our political system.\"',\n",
       "   \"These trends trace their roots back all the way to the civil rights revolution in the 1960s and have significantly accelerated since the closely divided election of 2000. But Trump's open appeal to the portions of white America most uneasy about cultural and social change, from immigration to gay and transgender rights and the changing role of women, have elevated these trends to an entirely new level. \",\n",
       "   'The result is that hardly any Republicans at any level now represent urban constituencies with the large immigrant populations that Trump has threatened with intensified ICE enforcement or demeaned with his calls for four liberal House Democratic women, three of whom were actually born in the US, to\"go back\" to where they came from before criticizing America.',\n",
       "   '\"I don\\'t see any serious plan or strategy to grow the party in urban America,\" said Curbelo, who was one of the few House Republicans to represent a seat with large populations of immigrant and non-white voters. \"And I see very limited effort to grow the party among the Hispanic community which was a major priority during the George W. Bush years and even afterwards during the Obama presidency. That is now virtually non-existent.\"',\n",
       "   'Instead, Curbelo said, Trump \"uses cities to intensify the culture war and agitate his base.\"',\n",
       "   \"Trump's victory in 2016, and his consistent support in polls from about 40-45% of the population, shows there is a significant audience for his hard-edged message on immigration and demographic change more broadly. But there is also a clear cost. In effect, Trump's bruising racially-infused nationalism is forcing the GOP to trade support among younger voters for older ones; secular voters for the most religiously conservative, especially evangelical Christians; diverse voters for whites; white collar whites for blue-collar whites; and metro areas for non-metro areas. \",\n",
       "   \"Since Trump's emergence Republicans have consolidated their control of small-town, exurban and rural communities. But that has come with significant losses for the GOP inside metropolitan areas even in red states, like Texas and Georgia.\",\n",
       "   'The trade Trump is imposing on the GOP was apparent in 2016 and enormously intensified in 2018. ',\n",
       "   'In 2016, Trump lost 16 of the 20 states where foreign-born residents constituted the largest share of the population and won 26 of the 30 states where they represent the smallest shares. Even in the relatively more diverse states he won, he lost the vast majority of the big urban centers where immigrants and other minorities generally concentrate. Overall, Trump lost 87 of the 100 largest US counties to Hillary Clinton by a combined margin of over 15 million votes, according to calculations by the Pew Research Center. Trump offset these losses by amassing the largest margins for Republicans in decades in small-town, exurban and rural areas.',\n",
       "   \"In 2018 House races, Republicans suffered only very modest losses outside of metropolitan area districts. And they gained three Senate seats in states with large populations of white voters who are rural, blue-collar, or evangelical Christians: North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri. But the party was routed in metropolitan House seats that contained significant populations of minorities, immigrants, singles, college-educated white voters, or all of the above. After sweeping losses in suburban districts from coast to coast, the GOP under Trump has been almost completely exiled from the dynamic metropolitan areas that account for the nation's vast majority of job growth and economic output.\",\n",
       "   'Democrats now hold over four-fifths of the House seats where minorities exceed their share of the national population and nearly 9 in 10 of the House seats with more foreign-born residents than average, according to a CNN analysis of census data. In the Senate, Democrats partially offset the Republican gains in older and rural Midwestern states by adding seats in the diverse, younger, rapidly growing Sunbelt battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada. The result is that after the 2018 election, Democrats now hold 32 of the 40 Senate seats in the 20 states with the highest share of immigrants in their population while Republicans hold 45 of the 60 in the 30 states with the fewest. In 2020, the top two Democratic Senate pick-up opportuntiies are among the top 20 immigration states -- Arizona and Colorado, with Georgia, another high-ranking state, presenting a more difficult chance. Democrats are also targeting about a dozen of the GOP House members remaining in high-immigrant seats.',\n",
       "   \"Because undocumented immigrants tend to flow largely toward communities with large existing immigrant communities, that means the places most threatened by Trump's threat to increase ICE enforcement are almost all places that have already demonstrated hostility to him and the party he is reshaping in his image.\",\n",
       "   'The non-partisan Migration Policy Institute estimates that there are at least 70,000 undocumented immigrants in 34 US counties; cumulatively those counties account for about 5.6 million undocumented immigrants, about half of the estimated US total. (The top 10 counties alone, all of them major metropolitan areas, account for nearly one-third of the total undocumented population.) In 2016, Trump lost 31 of those 34 counties and in 2018 two of those he carried -- Maricopa, around Phoenix in Arizona, and Tarrant, centered on Fort Worth in Texas -- broke for the Democrats in Senate races. ',\n",
       "   'Trump and some of his supporters have falsely claimed that voter fraud allowed undocumented immigrants to vote in these big urban places contributed to his losses in some states. It is, however, accurate to say that acceptance of an undocumented population in those communities is part of the fabric of attitudes that have made them so hostile to Trump.',\n",
       "   'Those public attitudes help explain why the mayors of almost all of the nation\\'s largest cities -- the very places where the undocumented population is concentrated -- felt so comfortable displaying public resistance to Trump\\'s enforcement initiative. Mayors Bill de Blasio of New York and Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, the nation\\'s two largest cities, joined many other mayors in publicly offering legal help to undocumented residents facing ICE enforcement. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN\\'s Poppy Harlow last Friday that Atlanta has \"closed our city detention centers to ICE because we don\\'t want to be complicit in family separation.\"  ',\n",
       "   'In an interview, Providence, Rhode Island, Mayor Jorge Elorza, the co-chair of the immigration reform task force at the US Conference of Mayors, captured the ferocity of the resistance from mayors to the threatened ICE raids. He called them \"blatantly racist\" and said Trump revealed their political intent with his tweets telegraphing the apparent operation. \"If it was about executing a public policy you wouldn\\'t give the heads up to these folks that these round ups and raids are coming,\" Elorza said. \"The goal...is to stoke fear in the broader immigrant community and to do it in a way that feeds red meat to their political base.\"',\n",
       "   'Elorza said almost all mayors consider such hardline enforcement tactics counterproductive to public safety because they strain relations between immigrant communities and law enforcement. \"We want whoever witnessed (a crime) to feel as comfortable as possible coming forward talking to the police,\" said Elorza, the US-born son of undocumented immigrants from Guatemala. \"If people are afraid to come to the police, they are less likely to speak up even they are witnesses.\"',\n",
       "   \"Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute's New York office, said in an interview that Trump's hardline approach is counterproductive even to his stated goal of increasing deportations. The reason, Chishti says, is that while many cities chafed under former President Barack Obama's deportation actions, they have been completely alienated by Trump's brusque immigration policies and language (including his attempts to cut federal policing aid to so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement). And cooperation from cities, Chishti says, is essential to removing large numbers of undocumented immigrants because three-fourths of those who are eventually deported are originally arrested not on immigration charges, but for other offenses and then found by ICE once they enter the criminal justice system. \",\n",
       "   '\"If you want large numbers (of deportations) you have to rely on...states and localities, because our criminal justice system is state and local not federal,\" he says. \"Therefore you need their cooperation. And if they are not cooperating you are not going to get big numbers.\"',\n",
       "   \"Yet within city governments there is a widespread sense that Trump's immigration agenda is essentially an effort by a Republican coalition centered primarily on the parts of America with fewest immigrants to impose their values and prejudices on the parts of America with the most.\",\n",
       "   'Trump \"has been able to convince folks that their way of life has been impacted primarily by the presence of undocumented immigrants in this country and I think that that message resonates more than anywhere else with the communities that just don\\'t have close contact with them,\" Elorza said. \"I personally live in a community where I know for a fact there are undocumented immigrants around. I see them. And if you get to know them you see they are not a threat to you. When you are not exposed to them you are more susceptible to buying this (negative) narrative, because you have the President of the United States telling you this is the case.\"',\n",
       "   'Conversely, Curbelo says he sees signs that too many Democrats are abandoning the hope of forging connections in less diverse, less urban areas generally more skeptical of immigrants. \"Obviously Republicans are not doing enough to change (the divide) and frankly Democrats aren\\'t either,\" he says. \"You hear some Democrats say we don\\'t want a white presidential candidate; that\\'s just as improper and scandalous. The bases of each respective party have too much of a gravitational pull.\"',\n",
       "   \"Trump's unrelentingly divisive agenda and language -- and the sharp Democratic response it has generated -- seems guaranteed in the 2020 election to widen the chasm between diverse, white-collar, immigrant-friendly urban America, where opposition to the President is centered, and his strongholds in preponderantly white, blue-collar, heavily Christian, non-urban America.\",\n",
       "   'This week\\'s repeated use of openly racist language from the White House -- like the new policy battles over ICE enforcement and asylum seekers, and the earlier struggles over Trump proposals to measure citizenship on the census, build a border wall, separate children from parents at the border, punish \"sanctuary cities,\" and slash legal immigration by the largest amounts since the 1920s -- show how committed the President is to mobilizing his \"coalition of restoration\" even at the price of inflaming the Democrats\\' \"coalition of transformation\" and potentially alienating swing voters.',\n",
       "   \"The racially incendiary conflicts of the past few days have provided perhaps the clearest preview yet of what's approaching as the places that represent what America is becoming square off against the places that reflect what it has been in next year's epic struggle for control of the nation's direction.\",\n",

       "   'Like his father in his prime, Rosselló sought to ride his boyish good looks and academic credentials to La Fortaleza. He played tennis like his dad, a former tennis champion on the island. He graduated from MIT with degrees in biomedical engineering and economics before earning a doctorate at the University of Michigan. ',\n",
       "   '\"Ricardo was able to take advantage of his last name,\" Negron Portillo said. \"People still remembered his father fondly.\" ',\n",
       "   \"Still, the elder Rosselló, at least initially, was apprehensive about his son's political ambitions, according to Companys. \",\n",
       "   '\"The way that his parents described it ... was that he was the most brilliant person in the family but he was an absent-minded professor like Dr. Emmett Brown in \\'Back to the Future,\\'\" he said.',\n",
       "   'Rosselló downplayed his lack of political and work experience, Companys said. ',\n",
       "   '\"He would say, \\'I really don\\'t think I need it. I think I can get elected without it,\" Companys recalled.   ',\n",
       "   'Rosselló ran for governor in 2016. He took office in January 2017 alongside a tight circle of loyal advisers who, like him, possessed little or no political experience, according to Negron Portillo, Campanys and others.',\n",
       "   '\"Ricardo and his friends may have let the boat come down,\" said Alvaro Cifuentes, who was part of Pedro Rosselló\\'s cabinet during his first term. \"I mean, you need to have a fortitude of historic proportion when you\\'re the leader of any state or any nation. It should not be taken lightly.\"',\n",
       "   \"His father's administration credited for big projects but plagued by corruption  \",\n",
       "   'Pedro Rosselló, 75, burst into electoral politics in the early 1990s. He was a longtime pediatric surgeon and, like the son who would follow his footsteps decades later, a relative political novice. ',\n",
       "   'But he had wide appeal among pro-statehood, commonwealth and independence supporters -- with promises to combat crime, improve education, increase health services and slash taxes. ',\n",
       "   '\"I didn\\'t know Pedro before\" the campaign, said Cifuentes, who at the time was a managing partner in a law firm on the island. \"He was recommended to me as a pediatric surgeon because my son needed a small surgery. I was enchanted by the demeanor and the care that he had toward my young son. How he gave us so much comfort.\"',\n",
       "   'Cifuentes became his campaign manager. The morning after the election, Rosselló offered him the post of secretary of government. ',\n",
       "   '\"I said, \\'Pedro, what\\'s that?\\'\" Cifuentes recalled. \"And his answer was, \\'I don\\'t know but it has to be my alter ego and someone that I can trust.\\'\"',\n",
       "   'The elder Rosselló would become the architect of large-scale projects like an urban metro rail system, a convention center complex and a sprawling coliseum that would eventually saddle the island in debt. ',\n",
       "   '\"We had a saying, \\'We don\\'t talk. We walk,\\'\" Cifuentes said. \"We were very good at implementing. And that all came from Pedro Rosselló, the doctor.\"',\n",
       "   'Rosselló dispatched the National Guard to crime-ridden housing projects. He slashed the bloated government workforce. He offered private health insurance to the poor.',\n",
       "   'But his second term was marked by corruption scandals involving dozens of ranking members of his administration and party, including his top personal assistant, a former education secretary and a former House speaker.  In the summer of 2000, a federal prosecutor was quoted as saying, \"In Puerto Rico, corruption has a first and last name -- the New Progressive Party.\" ',\n",
       "   '\"On one hand, Pedro Rosselló was remembered for the big projects and the good economy under his leadership and, on the other hand, people remember him because of the corruption of the times,\" Negron Portillo said. ',\n",
       "   'Pedro Rosselló was never charged or accused of any crimes. Over the years, he and supporters said the prosecutions were an attempt by political opponents to discredit the pro-statehood movement. ',\n",
       "   'Cifuentes said the scandals were the work of \"the usual suspects\" who have long infected island politics with patronage and cronyism.   ',\n",
       "   \"Pedro Rosselló, who served as governor until the end of 2000, was defeated when he tried to return to the governor's seat in 2004. \",\n",
       "   'His son, Ricardo, isolated in La Fortaleza after the resignations of many of his top aides and facing increasing protests and clashes in the streets, announced on July 24 that would step down. ',\n",
       "   '\"Pedro Rosselló, as an elected official from day one, never lived by the mantra of being a legend in his own mind,\" Cifuentes said.',\n",
       "   '\"But over the past two and half years, when you have a government where individuals believe they\\'re legends in their own minds, that always spells trouble.\"',\n",
